## Branch Prediction
Branch Prediction Algorithm for OutOfOrder Pipelines within area budgets of 1200bits, 2400bits and 3600bits.

The branch predictor model used is Per-Address Pattern History Table(PAp)

## Synopsis
The major gaol of this project is to implement a branch predictor, that satisfies given bitsize constraint and achieves an accurate prediction depending upon the data.

## Running
bash build.sh $bitSizeConstraint
Example: bash build.sh 1200
